  <meta name="description" content="Sympedia GenFw is a flexible and easy to use framework for software artifact generation. Input models can be associated with generators via extensible rule sets. Additional Content providers, generators and rules can be provided by Eclipse plugins. In this tutorial I will try to teach you the very basics of GenFw by walking through a simple example. You are expected to have some experience in Java programming, Eclipse plugin development and EMF usage (see http://www.eclipse.org/emf).">
