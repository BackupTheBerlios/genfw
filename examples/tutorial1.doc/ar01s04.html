        classes that the Listener methods take an instance of the 
        BeanBase class as the first argument, because it prevents the 
        callback method from calling the bean&rsquo;s business methods 
        without down-casting to the derived Bean class. With the 
        current design it is impossible to pass a Bean-classed instance 
        to the callbacks. A nifty solution to this problem is the 
        introduction of generated business interfaces that are 
        implemented by the BeanBase classes and that all clients of the 
        bean have to use. These interfaces would have to include 
        abstract declarations of the business methods, so that the 
        callback method of the listener can call them directly. The 
        only reason why I waited to mention this until page 15 is, that 
        this design would force us to model the abstract syntax of Java 
        methods and parameters in our beans meta model. Of course it is 
        feasible, but soon you will recognize that existing meta models 
        like Ecore itself, UML2 and others already provide all the 
        necessary infrastructure to model such things. Why should we 
        invent the wheel again? It could be easier to re-use these 
        models.</p><p>The Density Generator, for example, currently uses Ecore 
        to model packages, classes, methods and so on. Because Ecore is 
        (at least compared to UML2) a rather unexpressive meta model 
        (it closer relates to MOF than to UML2), I made extensive use 
        of generic model annotations that are evaluated by the 
        generator.</p></li><li><p>GenFw never writes files that are not changed, even if a 
        generator produced new output for that file. If the content is 
        the same as before, the file will not get a new modification 
        time stamp. This way there&rsquo;s usually no harm in frequently 
        using the Generate All action.</p></li><li><p>If you are using JDT&rsquo;s automatic code formatting facility 
        (maybe even in conjunction with the FormatOnSave plugin), the 
        physical content of a Java file might change due to generation 
        even if the logical content is the same. Only the formatting 
        changes, and changes, and &hellip;</p><p>For these situations GenFw provides a delegating 
        generator called Java Formatter. This generator first invokes 
        an arbitrary other generator on the same inpout object and 
        target path and then formats and returns the results of the 
        delegate generator. Unfortunately you have to add a Java 
        Formatter for each template to be delegated to. So far I have 
        not found another way to handle generator chains.</p></li><li><p>Generator Modularity: You can split your GenLibs and 
        GenApps as you like and let them refer to elements in the other 
        files. A GenApp is a GenLib, so you can even cope with a single 
        GenApp if you want. The only difference between the two is that 
        Inputs can only be contained in GenApps. The reason is the 
        possible project-relative path resolution of input files.</p></li><li><p>Personally I think that the meta models, the templates 
        and the resulting GenLib tend to change often due to new 
        requirements or simply due to maintenance, so I leave this 
        project in my workspace. But sometimes it is practical to 
        deploy a generator library (with all the templates and meta 
        models) as an installed plugin. This way it is also possible to 
        use generators out-of-the box that you installed via the 
        Eclipse Update Manager from the internet or an enterprise 
        repository. To refer to these generator libraries use a 
        resource URI like 
        <code class="code">platform:/plugin/&lt;pluing-id&gt;/&lt;entry-path&gt;</code>. 
        However, GenFw class loaders are not prepared out-of-the-box 
        for this situation! The plugin that you want the generator to 
        be installed in has to contribute to the 
        <code class="code">com.sympedia.genfw.externalLibraries</code> 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Extension Point</em></span>:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

   &lt;/extension&gt; 
 
&lt;/plugin&gt;</pre><p>The referenced <code class="code">BeansLibraryInitializer</code> class 
        must implement the interface 
        <code class="code">com.sympedia.genfw.IExternalLibraryInitializer</code>. 
        The only method to be implemented can safely be left empty, it 
        is not used for the moment. The class is only needed so that 
        GenFw can compute the class loader of the contributing plugin 
        at runtime.</p><pre class="programlisting">package tutorial1.gen.internal;

        like to mix generated code with hand-written code, it&rsquo;s most 
        certainly because you do like it, nevertheless ;-) Don&rsquo;t worry, 
        GenFw comes with a JMerge Generator that works similar to the 
        Java Formatter, it first delegates to another generator 
        (assumingly a JET Template) and then merges the result. You can 
        configure a custom merge.xml or leave the property empty to use 
        the CodeGen default one. Of course you can even prepend this 
        chain by a Java Formatter (as newer CodeGen versions can do, 
        too). GenFw uses JMerge 2.0.</p></li><li><p>If a JET Template is too heavy in a certain situation, 
        you can use a Static File Initializer to produce static 
        content, line by line.</p></li><li><p>If you want to use the original JET templates of the EMF 
        distribution, there are currently two ways: You can use the 
        Ecore Template generator or the EMF Generator. In both cases 
        the generator expects a .genmodel file to be used as the 
        Input.</p></li><li><p>With the Ecore Template generator you can generate 
        selected templates and choose to generate the Interface file or 
        the Implementation file. Note, that the Ecore templates don&rsquo;t 
        expect a pure GenBase instance (the input object ) to be passed 
        as argument! Rather it expects an Object[3] array. That&rsquo;s why 
        the Ecore Template generator is a special subclass of JET 
        Template. Attention: Before you use an Ecore Template 
        generator, you must patch org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore, see 
        the appendix!</p></li><li><p>With the EMF Generator you can generate a whole 
        GenPackage. Theoretically it is possible to feed the generator 
        with selected GenClassifiers, but unfortunately they will miss 
        some constructs that are only generated by a GenPackage 
        (Switch, Factory, &hellip;). Generating the GenPackage in addition is 
        not applicable, because there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to 
        prevent CodeGen from also iterating over all the contained 
        elements. This, in turn, would prevent you from overriding 
        selected templates! The only use for the EMF Generator that I 
        can see at the moment, is a way to integrate normal EMF 
        generations (without template overrides) into the GenFw user 
        interface.</p></li><li><p>After a while you will recognize that the more input 
        objects you have in your models and the more Rules you have in 
        your RuleSets the slower the generation will be. If you are 
        using BeanShellRules, GenFw will instantiate at least one 
        BeanShell interpreter per input object and Match Expression in 
        the Rule. This might be subject to further optimization in the 
        future, but for the moment of being the easiest way to speed up 
        generation is to specify a Match Class Name. This string value 
        is tested for equality against the fully qualified class name 
        of the input object (self), which is ways faster. But be 
        careful, you can&rsquo;t catch inheritance with this trick! So, to 
        let the BeanBaseRule properly match in the above example, you 
        have to specify tutorial1.gen.beans.impl.BeanImpl as Match 
        Class Name, not its interface tutorial1.gen.beans.Bean. In 
        addition the Match Expression is evaluated, but only after the 
        class names have been proven to match. Attention: If you have 
        issues with your generator&rsquo;s classpath, it can happen that you 
        get strange ClassNotFoundExceptions or ClassCastExceptions when 
        evaluating the Match Expression, the Target Path Expression or 
        when template code is invoked. This is almost always a sign 
        that your input objects have been loaded by a class loader 
        different from the one GenFw uses. Check, that your generator 
        (plugin) project properly references your meta model 
        plugins!</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%">&nbsp;</td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="40%">Steps&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td valign="top" align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;Patching CodeGen</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
